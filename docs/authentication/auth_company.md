# Selecting a Company

 

If your Adobe ID is linked with multiple login companies, you can select which company is used for each API request by including the `X-ADOBE-DMA-COMPANY` header in the API request.

For Client Credentials and Service Account Grants, the company is selected at the time when the app is created.
