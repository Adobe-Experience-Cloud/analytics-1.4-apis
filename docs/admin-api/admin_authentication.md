# Authentication

Version 1.4 of the administration API \(including the Bookmark, Company, Permissions, and Report Suite namespaces\) supports OAuth2 authentication, and maintains support for the version 1.3 password digest authentication mechanism.

See [Authentication](https://github.com/Adobe-Experience-Cloud/analytics-1.4-apis/blob/master/docs/authentication/c_authentication.md).
